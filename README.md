# This Repository is a TrainSIM Route's Items. This route is based on SIMTECH VISION's LONGHAI Railway DLC. But my route's location is in NANJING, South-Eastern China, not LONGHAI Railway's location, South-Western China. 
# It includes three labels, two Steam Locomotive repaints and a gate of a British factory in early 20 century's Nanjing, China. You use UTILITY.exe in RailWork folder to unpack the "UKTS_FPCNLuo.rwp", then these assets will be loaded in your TrainSIM editor automatically. You can read the introduction PDF for more detailed information.
